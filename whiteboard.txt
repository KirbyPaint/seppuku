Create an application that checks if a completed Sudoku puzzle is “legal.” In other words, it should ensure the following rules are met:

    [ ] Each row contains all numbers from 1 to 9 with no repeats.
    [ ] Each column contains all numbers from 1 to 9 with no repeats.
    [ ] Further Exploration: Each of the nine 3 x 3 grids contain all numbers from 1 to 9 with no repeats.

Sudoku board will be a 2D array of arrays -
Array will only contain positive integers 1-9 - no letters or invalid characters
Array will not be empty
Array = [[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]

each array
